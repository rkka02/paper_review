"abstract": "This letter demonstrates a quasi-real-time dynamic holographic 3D display by combining holographic stereography with a large-area updatable photorefractive polymer. Using a 50 Hz nanosecond pulsed laser to write hogels, the system refreshes images about every two seconds, supports multi-colour via angular multiplexing, and extends to full parallax via spatial multiplexing. A telepresence proof-of-concept captures multiple camera views at one site and transmits them over Ethernet to print and display a dynamic 3D hologram at another site."
